nmap in details

nmap is a tool to check the status of ports in any machine

Example1 : To scan a particular system for open ports
#nmap hostname

Example2 : Scanning for a single port on a machine
#nmap –p 22 hostname
–p indicates port.

Example3 : For scanning only ports
#nmap –F hostname

-F is for fast scan and this will not do any other scanning like IP address, hostname, operating system, and uptime etc.

Example4 : Scanning only TCP ports
#nmap –sT hostname
-s is for scanning and T is for only scanning of TCP ports

Example5 : Scanning only UDP ports
#nmap –sU hostname
-U indicates UDP port scanning

Exmaple6 : Scan for ports and get the version of different services running on that machine
#nmap –sV hostname
-V indicates version of each network service running on that host

Example7 : Check which protocol is supported by the remote machine
#nmap –sO hostname

Example8 : Scan a system for operating system and uptime details
# nmap -O hostname
-O is for operating system scan along with default port scan

Example9 : Scan a network
#nmap networkID/subnetmask
For the above command you can try in this way
#nmap x.x.x.x/24
